## 8th to 10th July 2025: Initial Research

I spent these days researching into different motors, vacuum pumps, and robot arms.<br>
I decided that the gripper will have 4 DOFs, 1 each for angular movement on all 3 axes (x, y, and z) and 1 for controlling the air pressure in the end effector. I will use the [SC15 Servo](https://www.waveshare.com/sc15-servo.htm) for rotation on the z and y axes, and the [SC09 Servo](https://www.waveshare.com/sc09-servo.htm) for the x axis and end-effector.<br>
I also worked on the base of the gripper on 10th July (today), adding mounting screw holes for the z-axis motor.
