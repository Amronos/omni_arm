## 13th to 18th July 2025: Complete Y-Axis Housing

I spent these days reworking/creating the housing for the y-axis motor, considering various shapes and sizes for the design. I ended up going with a simple cubic housing.<br>
I also researched into what syringe to use and the servo motor controlling it will be placed in the arm. Since there were no small syringes which could offer the volume of air I wanted (~20ml), I decided to create a completely separate assembly for it.

## 11th to 12th July 2025: Complete Base

During these two days I completed 3D modelling the base of the gripper which houses the z-axis motor and to which the servo driver is attached.<br>
I also created the rotational base for the y-axis motor that is attached to the z-axis motor.

## 8th to 10th July 2025: Initial Research

I spent these days researching into different motors, vacuum pumps, and robot arms.<br>
I decided that the gripper will have 4 DOFs, 1 each for angular movement on all 3 axes (x, y, and z) and 1 for controlling the air pressure in the end effector. I will use the [SC15 Servo](https://www.waveshare.com/sc15-servo.htm) for rotation on the z and y axes, and the [SC09 Servo](https://www.waveshare.com/sc09-servo.htm) for the x axis and end-effector.<br>
I also worked on the base of the gripper on 10th July (today), adding mounting screw holes for the z-axis motor.

**Total time spent: 6h**
